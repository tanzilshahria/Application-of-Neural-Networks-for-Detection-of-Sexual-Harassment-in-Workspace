# Application-of-Neural-Networks-for-Detection-of-Sexual-Harassment-in-Workspace
Due to the insufficiency of sexual harassment at workplaces dataset, we created our own dataset from social media videos for the model. Conclusively, following transfer learning methods upon three well known pre-trained models of Keras have been implied for getting better accuracy insight of our model.
